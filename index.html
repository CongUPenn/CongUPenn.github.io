            The class will work together to build an assemblage sculpture from found 
            and classroom materials. Individual students will then create a “CSS Still 
            Life” that must consider HTML layout, nesting, and CSS styling. Final work 
            may employ CSS animations and any degree of design reduction and abstraction. 
            All HTML & CSS drawings must be horizontally oriented at 800x600px.

            that includes a minimum of 5 separate pages and a navigational tool/toolset. 
            No single page and its linked content can be larger than 5 megabytes.

            As a class, students will work together to design and build a Web Ring 
            that links and loops between all students’ web publications (Section 1 Final Project). 
            The Web Ring may be an external site of links (an index), but must also incorporate some form of modular code 
            that is implemented on each student’s publication site.

            Students will create a self-contained, single-page site that employs hover effects and CSS selectors 
            to assist and encourage user interaction. Your site must include a minimum of 5 images 
            (observing optimization and best practices) and all elements must contain adequate metadata/alt text. 
            Your site must also account for viewport sizes to serve comparable or alternate user experiences.

            Computational science and, by proxy, web design have a unique history tethered to the users’ system clock. 
            Students will follow a formalized process from brainstorming and sketching 
            to prototyping and construction to create a browser-based design 
            that employs the system clock’s 3 basic events (seconds, minutes, hours) using p5.js. 
            Your “clock” doesn’t need to resemble a traditional clock, and may instead employ other functions 
            that are triggered by these events.

            Individually or in small groups of 2 or 3, students will design and write a program or script to be performed. 
            This can be taken literally, as in your script is intended to be enlivened by actors. 
            This can be taken loosely and all terms can be creatively interpreted. Regardless, 
            all performances must incorporate learned principles of scripted “functions,” 
            and must also include an element of “chance.”

            An API (Application Programming Interface) allows applications, tools, 
            or services to safely “share” restricted data with other applications, tools, or services. 
            The availability of this “public facing” data allows developers to build connected/supplementary platforms 
            that may ease or augment a user’s experience. In teams of two (+), students will work together 
            to create and execute an interactive design tool that employs API linking with IFTTT (If This Then That). 
            Teams must also design and develop a website that serves to promote this tool and document its real-life application and usage.

            Using p5.js, students will program a generative design that employs functions, loops, and conditionals. 
            Designs must also incorporate an element of randomness or chance in their code. 
            Students will work to embed this design within a separate website that also incorporates designed and user-interactive elements.
